List of questions I need to solve

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
will use hash table but cant understand the logic of skipping numbers


3674. Minimum Operations to Equalize Array
uses bitwise AND

3658. GCD of Odd and Even Sums
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
    Sum of the first 4 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
    Sum of the first 4 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(16, 20) = 4

cant seem to build logic\
